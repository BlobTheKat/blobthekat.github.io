<h3>Warning about bookmarklets</h3>
Bookmarklets work by executing javascript code on the tab it's used in. Javascript is an easy way to build or modify a web page, but also an easy way for attackers to extract credentials from site you are logged in to. For the same reason I wouldn't want you to lose your details to an attacker, I encourage you to exercise caution, only run this bookmarklet if you are 100% confident that it is safe to do so. You're welcome to try it on a website or browser where you're not logged in to anything, though.
